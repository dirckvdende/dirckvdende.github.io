- title: Master's Thesis on Quantum Computation using WMC
  description: I finished my master in Computer Science by doing a thesis on using weighted model counting (WMC) tools to efficiently perform quantum computations. We developed a custom framework for performing matrix operations using these WMC tools, and tested its performance on several physical models.
