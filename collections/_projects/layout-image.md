A small Python package for creating basic images with XML layouts. I built it as a short-term project since I needed the functionality for another project I was working on at the time.

The package can be installed using Pip. For more information see the relevant PyPI page below. The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/dirckvdende/layout-image).
