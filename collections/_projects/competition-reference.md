I participated in the BAPC and NWERC programming contests in 2022, 2023, and 2024. In these competitions a document of at most 25 pages can be used as reference material. I wrote the document between the 2022 and 2023 contests and used it with my team in the 2023 and 2024 contests. View the reference document on GitHub below:

BAPC stands for Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest ([website](https://bapc.eu/)) and NWERC stands for Northwestern Europe Regional Contest ([website](https://nwerc.eu/)). The BAPC preliminary in Leiden is also known as the "Leidsch Kamioenschap Programmeren". It is organized by the Leische Flesch study association ([website, in Dutch](https://www.deleidscheflesch.nl/p/lkp)).

## Placements

Each of the three years I participated in a team of three people, changing teams between 2022 and 2023. The BAPC preliminary was held for Leiden University students.
