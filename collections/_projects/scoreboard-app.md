A small app to keep track of player's points while playing board/card games, or any other type of game that requires keeping track of scores. Scores are automatically sorted and the history of scores can be viewed.

I developed this as a one-day project. It is currently available online at the link below:

I originally created this app to keep track of the scores in a game called [Flip 7](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420087/flip-7). I would highly recommend playing it if you find it somewhere!
