For the Multimedia Systems course the main project involved splitting into groups and developing some application related to multimedia systems. I worked together with Dekel Zak ([GitHub](https://github.com/dekelzeldov); [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dekelzeldov/)) and Perri van den Berg ([GitHub](https://github.com/PerrivandenBerg); [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perrivandenberg/)) to create a game that can played pure with hand gestures and movement as input. You can view the source code below. Installation instructions can be found [at the bottom of this page](#installation).

The application we created contains three mini-games, each showcasing a different way of interacting with the game. I've listed them below.
