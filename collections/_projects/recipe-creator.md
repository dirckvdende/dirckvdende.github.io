I wanted to learn a new framework, so I decided to build a cooking recipe creation app using Vue.js. In this web app you can add text, images, an ingredients list and a list of steps. After creating the recipe, the user can print it (or save as PDF) or save it in a custom file format to edit it later.

{% include center-button.html icon="link" text="Open recipe creator app" href="https://dirckvdende.github.io/recipe-creator" %}

## Custom file format

For this project I developed a custom file format to store the recipe on the user's computer. Using the import/export buttons in the web app the recipe can be downloaded/uploaded. Read more about this custom file format and the project code in the project [README](https://github.com/dirckvdende/recipe-creator/).
